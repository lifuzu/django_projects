### Install

Store the Vault TLS certificates that we created (docs/certs/ssl_toolkit.md) in a Secret:
```
$ kubectl create secret generic vault \
    --from-file=tools/certs/ca.pem \
    --from-file=tools/certs/vault.pem \
    --from-file=tools/certs/vault-key.pem
secret/vault created
$ kubectl describe secrets vault
Name:         vault
Namespace:    default
Labels:       <none>
Annotations:  <none>

Type:  Opaque

Data
====
ca.pem:         1168 bytes
vault-key.pem:  1675 bytes
vault.pem:      1241 bytes

```

ConfigMap
Add a new file for the Vault config called tools/provision/vault/config.json:
```
{
  "listener": {
    "tcp":{
      "address": "127.0.0.1:8200",
      "tls_disable": 0,
      "tls_cert_file": "/etc/tls/vault.pem",
      "tls_key_file": "/etc/tls/vault-key.pem"
    }
  },
  "storage": {
    "consul": {
      "address": "consul:8500",
      "path": "vault/",
      "disable_registration": "true",
      "ha_enabled": "true"
    }
  },
  "ui": true
}
```
Here, we configured Vault to use the Consul backend (which supports high availability), defined the TCP listener for Vault, enabled TLS, added the paths to the TLS certificate and the private key, and enabled the Vault UI. Review the docs for more info on configuring Vault.
https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/configuration/index.html

Save this config in a ConfigMap:
```
$ kubectl create configmap vault --from-file=tools/provision/vault/config.json
configmap/vault created
$ kubectl describe configmap vault
Name:         vault
Namespace:    default
Labels:       <none>
Annotations:  <none>

Data

config.json:
----
{
  "listener": {
    "tcp":{
      "address": "127.0.0.1:8200",
      "tls_disable": 0,
      "tls_cert_file": "/etc/tls/vault.pem",
      "tls_key_file": "/etc/tls/vault-key.pem"
    }
  },
  "storage": {
    "consul": {
      "address": "consul:8500",
      "path": "vault/",
      "disable_registration": "true",
      "ha_enabled": "true"
    }
  },
  "ui": true
}

Events:  <none>
```

Create service with tools/provision/vault/service.yaml:
```
$ kubectl create -f tools/provision/vault/service.yaml
service/vault created
$ kubectl get service vault
NAME    TYPE        CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)    AGE
vault   ClusterIP   10.107.153.152   <none>        8200/TCP   9s
```

Create deployment with tools/provision/vault/deployment.yaml:
```
$ kubectl create -f tools/provision/vault/deployment.yaml
deployment.extensions/vault created
```

To test, grab the Pod name and then forward the port:
```
$ kubectl get pods
NAME                     READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
consul-0                 1/1     Running   0          23m
consul-1                 1/1     Running   0          23m
consul-2                 1/1     Running   0          23m
vault-69c7d8bcdd-l4hgl   2/2     Running   0          45s

$ kubectl port-forward vault-69c7d8bcdd-l4hgl 8200:8200
```
Make sure you can view the UI at https://localhost:8200.


Quick Test
With port forwarding still on, in a new terminal window, navigate to the project directory and set the VAULT_ADDR and VAULT_CACERT environment variables:
```
$ export VAULT_ADDR=https://127.0.0.1:8200
$ export VAULT_CACERT="tools/certs/ca.pem"
```

Install the Vault client locally, if you don't already have it, and then init Vault with a single key:
```
$ vault operator init -key-shares=1 -key-threshold=1
Unseal Key 1: hDV0E5GYXG2+eUaLdzQDzkmsmTGecI/z9qsmb7ugx84=

Initial Root Token: 3xSO00i9BJqr7yk2St2EnuLU

Vault initialized with 1 key shares and a key threshold of 1. Please securely
distribute the key shares printed above. When the Vault is re-sealed,
restarted, or stopped, you must supply at least 1 of these keys to unseal it
before it can start servicing requests.

Vault does not store the generated master key. Without at least 1 key to
reconstruct the master key, Vault will remain permanently sealed!

It is possible to generate new unseal keys, provided you have a quorum of
existing unseal keys shares. See "vault operator rekey" for more information.
```

Unseal:
```
$ vault operator unseal

Authenticate with the root token:
```
$ vault login
Token (will be hidden):
Success! You are now authenticated. The token information displayed below
is already stored in the token helper. You do NOT need to run "vault login"
again. Future Vault requests will automatically use this token.

Create a new secret:
```
$ vault kv put secret/precious foo=bar

```
$ vault kv get secret/precious
