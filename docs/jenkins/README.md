### Create Jenkins Dockerfile at `tools/applications/jenkins/Dockerfile`

### Create Jenkins plugins file at `tools/applications/jenkins/plugins.txt`

### Build the Jenkins image
```
$ docker build -t 127.0.0.1:30400/jenkins:latest -f tools/applications/jenkins/Dockerfile tools/applications/jenkins
...
Successfully built 0681f585302e
Successfully tagged 127.0.0.1:30400/jenkins:latest
```

### Push the Jenkins image to cluster registry (with socat proxy)
# Run the socat proxy container (Refer to socat/README.md)
```
$ docker push 127.0.0.1:30400/jenkins:latest
```

### Create Jenkins Kubernetes manifest at `tools/provision/manifests/jenkins.yaml`

### Deploy Jenkins in K8s cluster
```
$ kubectl apply -f tools/provision/manifests/jenkins.yaml
persistentvolume/jenkins created
persistentvolumeclaim/jenkins-claim created
serviceaccount/jenkins created
clusterrolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/Jenkins-cluster-admin created
configmap/kubectl-jenkins-context created
service/jenkins created
deployment.extensions/jenkins created

$ kubectl rollout status deployment/jenkins
Waiting for deployment "jenkins" rollout to finish: 0 of 1 updated replicas are available...
deployment "jenkins" successfully rolled out
```

### Inspect all the pods that are running. Youâ€™ll see a pod for Jenkins now.
```
$ kubectl get pods
NAME                          READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
...
jenkins-f9ffd4b8b-6pnb2       1/1     Running   0          4m24s
...
```

### Open the Jenkins UI in a web browser.
```
$ minikube service jenkins
```

### Display the Jenkins admin password with the following command, and right-click to copy it.
```
$ kubectl exec -it `kubectl get pods --selector=app=jenkins --output=jsonpath={.items..metadata.name}` cat /var/jenkins_home/secrets/initialAdminPassword
...
edadcf9de1174a9794d2dcf52d8e0ea3
...
```

### Switch back to the Jenkins UI. Paste the Jenkins admin password in the box and click Continue. Click `Install suggested plugins`. Plugins have actually been pre-downloaded during the Jenkins image build, so this step should finish fairly quickly.

### Create an admin user and credentials, and click `Save and Continue`. (Make sure to remember these credentials as you will need them for repeated logins.)
