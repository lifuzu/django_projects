### Minikube Ingress addon
If your cluster is running in Minikube you can enable the Ingress controller just executing:
```
$ minikube addons enable ingress
ingress was successfully enabled
```
After a couple of minutes you should be able to see the controller running in the kube-system namespace:
```
$ kubectl get pod -n kube-system -l app.kubernetes.io/name
NAME                                       READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
default-http-backend-5ff9d456ff-wnpzl      1/1     Running   0          10m
nginx-ingress-controller-7c66d668b-zqbzf   1/1     Running   0          10m
